Client-Hints extension for Chrome
============

**Work In Progress**

Chrome plugin to add Client-Hints HTTP header, for more on Client-Hints see https://github.com/igrigorik/http-client-hints

This plugin enables the header to be set and/or overriden in Chrome so I can experiment with it.


## Installation

Clone the respository and  from Chrome's Extension Page, choose *Load Unpacked Extension*.

- The hint values can be changed by editing defaults.js
- [Example nginx server config](https://gist.github.com/igrigorik/6372614) to serve images based on DPR hint in CH
